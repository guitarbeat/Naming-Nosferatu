## 🎯 What Makes Name Nosferatu Different

**This isn't just another name picker.** It's a deliberate process of elimination, comparison, and discovery. Every name goes through a lifecycle of scrutiny:

**Candidate** → **Intake** → **Tournament** → **Winner** → **Archive**

Each tournament uses the same mathematical ranking system that ranks chess grandmasters. Your preferences update instantly. The names demand your full attention.

### The Obsession Loop

1. **Choose names** from curated collections or add your own
2. **Compare relentlessly** - two names at a time, no shortcuts
3. **Watch rankings evolve** in real-time as you vote
4. **Discover patterns** in your preferences and decisions
5. **Start again** - the search for perfection never ends
