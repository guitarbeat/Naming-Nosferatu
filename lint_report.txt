The inferred dependency was `handleAnalysisModeToggle`, but the source dependencies were [names, selectedNames, toggleName, toggleNameById, selectedCount, hiddenIds, filterConfig, refetch, setNames, setHiddenIds, showSelectedOnly, selectedCategory, searchTerm, sortBy, isSwipeMode, showCatPictures, filterStatus, userFilter, sortOrder, selectionFilter, analysisMode].
