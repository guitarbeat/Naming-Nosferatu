UNUSED FILES ANALYSIS
====================

Files that are NOT imported or used anywhere:

1. src/features/auth/Login.tsx
   - Status: UNUSED
   - Reason: Replaced by CombinedLoginTournamentSetup
   - Note: Login.module.css is still used by CombinedLoginTournamentSetup

2. src/features/tournament/ModernTournamentSetup.tsx
   - Status: UNUSED
   - Reason: Replaced by CombinedLoginTournamentSetup
   - Note: Uses tournamentStore which is also unused

3. src/features/tournament/TournamentSetup.tsx
   - Status: UNUSED
   - Reason: Replaced by CombinedLoginTournamentSetup
   - Note: TournamentSetup.module.css is still used by CombinedLoginTournamentSetup

ACTIVELY USED FILES:
- CombinedLoginTournamentSetup.tsx (used in ViewRouter)
- All component files in components/ directory
- All hook files in hooks/ directory
- All CSS files are being used

RECOMMENDATION:
These 3 files can be safely removed as they've been replaced by CombinedLoginTournamentSetup.
However, keep the CSS files (Login.module.css, TournamentSetup.module.css) as they're still used.
