## 2026-06-18 - Added Proper ARIA roles to custom Tab Navigation
**Learning:** When building custom tab components from mapped arrays of button elements, using `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `aria-selected={condition}` is essential for proper screen reader communication and accessibility standards.
**Action:** Always ensure mapped button lists acting as tabs in custom navigation components include these explicit ARIA roles.
## 2026-06-23 - Accessibility of dynamically rendered icon-only buttons
**Learning:** When using components like `<X>` (from `lucide-react`) within an interactive container (like `<motion.button>`) specifically conditionally rendered via state (e.g., clearing a search input), it's easy to overlook `aria-label` because the element is dynamically injected.
**Action:** Always manually verify any temporary or conditionally rendered interactive elements for standard accessibility traits like `aria-label`, especially those handling contextual inputs like "Clear search".
