## 2023-10-24 - Focus Management in Disappearing UI
**Learning:** When interactive elements (like an "X" clear button) are removed from the DOM (because they only show conditionally based on state), focus is completely lost for keyboard and screen reader users. This leaves users stranded in the body element.
**Action:** When creating components with conditional UI that removes itself upon interaction, explicitly manage focus by adding a `useRef` to a relevant nearby input or element, and call `.focus()` right before or alongside the state update that causes the unmount.
