# Reference File Integration System

This directory contains the implementation of the Reference File Integration System, which provides an automated workflow for integrating reference implementation files from a temporary directory into the proper project structure.

## Structure

- `types.ts` - Core TypeScript interfaces and types for the integration system
- `index.ts` - Main entry point that exports all public APIs
- `types.test.ts` - Tests for type definitions and setup verification

## Core Types

### File Analysis
- `FileType` - Enum for different file types (component, hook, service, utility, type)
- `FileAnalysis` - Complete analysis of a file including dependencies and exports
- `Dependency` - Represents an import dependency
- `Export` - Represents an exported symbol

### Dependency Graph
- `DependencyGraph` - Graph structure for tracking file dependencies
- `FileNode` - Node in the dependency graph
- `IntegrationStatus` - Status of file integration (pending, in_progress, completed, failed, skipped)

### Integration Engine
- `IntegrationResult` - Result of integrating a file
- `Conflict` - Represents a merge conflict
- `MergeStrategy` - Strategy for merging files

### Build Verification
- `BuildResult` - Result of build verification
- `BuildError` - Represents a build error
- `BuildWarning` - Represents a build warning

### File Management
- `BackupInfo` - Information about file backups
- `IntegrationState` - Overall state of the integration process
- `IntegrationConfig` - Configuration for the integration system

## Testing

The system uses:
- **Vitest** for test execution
- **fast-check** for property-based testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test              # Run tests once
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
```

## Development Status

✅ Task 1: Project structure and core types - COMPLETE
- Created `src/services/integration/` directory
- Defined all TypeScript interfaces and types from design document
- Set up fast-check library for property-based testing
- Configured Vitest for testing
- Verified all types compile without errors
