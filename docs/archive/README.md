## Why Archived?

These files were consolidated to:
1. **Eliminate redundancy** - Multiple files covered the same topics
2. **Create single sources of truth** - Each topic now has one primary document
3. **Improve maintainability** - Update one file instead of multiple
4. **Follow DRY principles** - No repeated information

## Accessing Archived Content

If you need to reference the original files:
- They are preserved here in `docs/archive/`
- All content has been merged into the new consolidated files
- The new files are the authoritative sources

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these files, they can be moved back to `docs/`, but it's recommended to use the consolidated versions instead.
