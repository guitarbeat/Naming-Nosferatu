## Sentence Length Guidelines

### Targets by Content Type

| Content Type   | Target Length | Maximum  | Example                        |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| Headlines      | 3-8 words     | 10 words | "Tournament Results"           |
| Buttons        | 1-3 words     | 4 words  | "Start New Tournament"         |

### How to Check
- Count words between punctuation marks
- Aim for average of 12-18 words per sentence
- Split sentences longer than 20 words

---

## Voice Guidelines

### Active Voice (Preferred)

**When to Use**: 80%+ of the time

**Examples**:
- ✅ "You select names for your tournament"
- ✅ "The system updates rankings automatically"
- ✅ "Choose your favorite name"

**Why**: Clearer, more direct, easier to understand

### Passive Voice (Use Sparingly)

**When to Use**: Only when the receiver is more important than the doer

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Names are ranked automatically" (focus on names, not system)
- ❌ "Names are selected by you" (should be "You select names")

**Why Avoid**: Often unclear, wordier, harder to understand

---

## Paragraph Structure

### Length Guidelines

- **Maximum**: 3-4 sentences
- **Ideal**: 2-3 sentences
- **Minimum**: 1 sentence (for emphasis)

### Formatting

- Use line breaks between paragraphs
- Keep related ideas together
- One main idea per paragraph

### Examples

**Good** (2 sentences):
> Compare names side-by-side. Choose your favorite.

**Good** (3 sentences):
> Select 4-16 cat names for your tournament. You can choose from curated collections or add custom names. The tournament will start automatically when you're ready.

**Too Long** (5+ sentences):
> Select 4-16 cat names for your tournament. You can choose from curated collections that we've put together, or you can add your own custom names if you prefer. The tournament will start automatically when you're ready, and you don't need to do anything else. The system will generate optimal pairings for you, and you can begin voting right away. Rankings will update in real-time as you make your choices.

---

## Heading Guidelines

### Hierarchy

```
H1: Page title (one per page)
  └─ H2: Major sections (2-4 per page)
      └─ H3: Subsections (as needed)
          └─ H4+: Rarely needed
```

### Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: "Tournament Results" not "Results"
- **Be Concise**: 3-8 words for H1, 3-10 words for H2
- **Use Title Case or Sentence Case**: Be consistent
- **Avoid Questions**: "How to Start" not "How Do I Start?"
- **No Punctuation**: Avoid periods, colons at end

### Examples

**Good**:
- "Tournament Results"
- "Select Your Names"
- "View Rankings"

**Avoid**:
- "Tournament Results Page" (redundant)
- "How to Start a Tournament?" (question format)
- "Selecting Names for Your Tournament:" (punctuation)

---

## Link Text Guidelines

### Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive**: Users should know where they're going
- **Minimum 2-3 words**: "Start Tournament" not "Start"
- **Match Destination**: Link text should match page title/heading
- **Avoid Generic Text**: No "click here", "more", "link"

### Examples

**Good**:
- "Start a new tournament"
- "View tournament results"
- "Edit your profile"

**Avoid**:
- "Click here to start"
- "More"
- "Link"
- "Read more"

### Accessibility

- Link text should make sense out of context
- Screen readers announce links, so be clear
- Don't use URLs as link text

---

## Button Text Guidelines

### Best Practices

- **Action Verbs**: Start with a verb
- **1-3 words**: "Start Tournament" not "Click to Start Tournament"
- **Be Specific**: "Save Changes" not "Save"
- **No "Click"**: Button implies clicking
- **Present Tense**: "Start" not "Starting"

### Examples

**Good**:
- "Start Tournament"
- "Save Changes"
- "View Results"
- "Try Again"

**Avoid**:
- "Click to Start"
- "Save Now"
- "You Can Start Tournament"
- "Starting..."

---

## Error Message Guidelines

### Structure

1. **What happened** (brief)
2. **What to do** (actionable)
3. **Why it happened** (optional, if helpful)

### Tone

- **Friendly but clear**: Not apologetic or technical
- **Helpful**: Tell users what to do next
- **Brief**: 5-10 words for main message

### Examples

**Good**:
- "Unable to save. Please try again."
- "Connection lost. Check your internet and refresh."
- "Name already exists. Choose a different name."

**Avoid**:
- "Error 500: Internal Server Error"
- "An unexpected error occurred"
- "Something went wrong. Sorry!"

---

## Instruction Text Guidelines

### Structure

- **Number steps**: Use ordered lists
- **One action per step**: Don't combine actions
- **Start with verbs**: "Select", "Click", "Enter"
- **Be specific**: "Select 4 names" not "Select some names"

### Examples

**Good**:
1. Select 4-16 cat names
2. Click "Start Tournament"
3. Vote on each match

**Avoid**:
1. You should select some cat names, maybe 4 to 16 of them
2. Then you can click the button that says "Start Tournament"
3. After that, you'll need to vote on matches

---

## Word Choice Guidelines

### Use Simple Words

| Instead of            | Use           |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| utilize               | use           |
| facilitate            | help          |
| implement             | add           |
| functionality         | feature       |
| nomenclature          | name          |
| data-driven           | based on data |
| scientifically-driven | uses science  |

### Avoid Jargon

**Technical Terms to Avoid** (unless explaining):
- Elo rating algorithm
- Database schema
- API endpoints
- State management

**When You Must Use Jargon**:
- Explain it the first time
- Use simple language alongside
- Provide examples

### Examples

**Before** (jargon-heavy):
> A scientifically-driven tournament platform that helps you discover the perfect cat name using the same Elo rating algorithm that ranks chess grandmasters.

**After** (simplified):
> Find the perfect cat name through tournaments. Compare names head-to-head. See which ones rank highest. The system uses the same ranking method as chess players.

## Tone & Voice

### Overall Tone

- **Friendly**: Warm but professional
- **Helpful**: Focus on helping users succeed
- **Clear**: No ambiguity
- **Confident**: Users can trust the system

### Voice Characteristics

- **Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Direct**: Get to the point quickly
- **Positive**: Focus on what users can do
- **Encouraging**: Help users feel capable

### Examples

**Good Tone**:
> Welcome! Let's find the perfect name for your cat. Start by selecting your favorite names.

**Avoid**:

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### Screen Readers

- **Descriptive text**: All interactive elements need clear labels
- **Context**: Text should make sense when read aloud
- **Instructions**: Don't rely on visual cues alone

### Examples

**Good** (screen reader friendly):
```jsx
<button aria-label="Start new tournament">
  Start New
</button>
```

**Avoid**:
```jsx
<button>Click here</button>
```

### Color & Contrast

- **Don't rely on color alone**: Use text + icons
- **High contrast**: Ensure text is readable
- **Clear labels**: Icons need text labels
