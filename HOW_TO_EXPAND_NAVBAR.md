# How to Expand the Navbar

## The Problem
The navbar can be collapsed, which hides all the navigation buttons (Gallery, Analysis, Logout, etc.). When collapsed, you only see a hamburger icon (☰) on the left side.

## The Solution
**Click the hamburger icon (☰) in the top-left corner** to expand the navbar and see all buttons.

## What You'll See When Expanded

Once expanded, you'll see these buttons from left to right:

1. **☰ Hamburger icon** (click to collapse again)
2. **Tournament** (home button)
3. **📷 Gallery** (cat photo gallery)
4. **📊 Analysis** (analysis mode toggle)
5. **💡 Suggest** (suggest a new name)
6. **👤 Log out [Your Name]** (logout button - only when logged in)
7. **🌙/☀️ Theme toggle** (light/dark mode)
8. **☰ Mobile menu** (on small screens)

## Quick Fix
If you can't find the hamburger icon, try:
1. Look at the very top-left of the page
2. It should be a small circular button with three horizontal lines
3. Click it to expand the navbar

## Technical Note
The navbar collapse state is now saved in your browser's localStorage, so it will remember your preference. If you want it to always start expanded, you can clear your browser's localStorage for this site.
